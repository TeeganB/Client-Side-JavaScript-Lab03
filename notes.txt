JavaScript is an "object-oriented" langugage

In JavaScript, everything is an object. (except for language constructs, keyword and operators).

Objects play many roles from representing data to manipulating of html documents via document objedt model


EXAMPLE:
                        
        const object = {
  Property Name (key) --> hello: world <-- Property Value
        }



Objects
- an Object is an unordered collection of data including promitive types fucntions and other Objects

- an object is a colletion of properties, each of which has a name and a Value

- JavaScript objects are dynamic -- properties can be added and deleted.



OBJECT METHODS

- Methods are actions that can be performed on objects
- A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.


CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION 

- Constructor function is another way to create objects
- Rules for construction function:
    1. Constructor function name will be th eobject types
    2. 'this' operator is used in construction function to refer to the object
    3. There shall be no "return" statement in constructor function.
